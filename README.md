# vtk-scene

This is an **exploratory** project and is not aimed to be used in production.
Its intent is for us to explore how to make it easier to create VTK
visualization in Python leveraging the same concepts introduced within ParaView.
The API is expected to change at any time to support our exploration goals.
Please use it at your own risk.

**What it is:** A Python library to use on top of VTK for creating interactive
visualization mainly focusing on the rendering definition of a view taking cue
from ParaView model. **Mission:** To provide a library that reduce the burden of
defining VTK visualization pipelines. **Vision:** To create an open solution
that is easy to maintain and expand while not limiting the user in any specific
way.
